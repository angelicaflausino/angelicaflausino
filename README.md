### Hi there 🤘

My name is Angélica Flausino Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Back-End Developer since 2012 and currently Software Developer at  [Softplan](http://www.softplan.com.br). I'm passionate about open source projects and learn Front-End frameworks (why not?), but C# is love of my life!

**Technologies I've worked with:**

- Web Forms, Windows Forms, Xamarin, PowerBI (yes I'm old) 👵
- Knockout, Angular.js, Jquery, Javascript Vanilla, Node.js
- Sql Server, MySQL, SQLite, Mongo...

**Technologies I currently work on:**

- .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, Docker...

**I am trying to learn:**

- React (just because they said that javascript will control the 🌎)

In my free time: 🎮 🎥 🍻 🌊

Would you like to find me?
